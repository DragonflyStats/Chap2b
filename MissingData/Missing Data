\section{What is multiple imputation?}

Imputation, the practice of 'filling in' missing data with plausible values, is an attractive approach to analyzing incomplete data. It apparently solves the missing-data problem at the beginning of the analysis. However, a naive or unprincipled imputation method may create more problems than it solves, distorting estimates, standard errors and hypothesis tests, as documented by Little and Rubin (1987) and others.

 Consider the probability of missingness
 Are certain groups more likely to have missing values?
 Example: Respondents in service occupations less likely to report 
income
 Are certain responses more likely to be missing?
 Example: Respondents with high income less likely to report income
 Certain analysis methods assume a certain probability 
distribution

 Missing Completely at Random (MCAR)
 Missing value (y) neither depends on x nor y
 Example: some survey questions asked of a simple random 
sample of original sample
 Missing at Random (MAR)
 Missing value (y) depends on x, but not y
 Example: Respondents in service occupations less likely to report 
income
 Missing not at Random (NMAR)
 The probability of a missing value depends on the variable that 
is missing
 Example: Respondents with high income less likely to report income

Exploring missing data mechanisms
 Can‟t be 100% sure about probability of missing (since we 
don‟t actually know the missing values)
 Could test for MCAR (t-tests)—but not totally accurate 
 Many missing data methods assume MCAR or MAR but 
our data often are MNAR
 Some methods specifically for MNAR
 Selection model (Heckman)
 Pattern mixture models
