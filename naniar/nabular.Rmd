56 nabular
nabular Convert data into nabular form by binding shade to it

####  Description 

Binding a shadow matrix to a regular dataframe converts it into nabular data, which makes it easier
to visualise and work with missing data.

####  Usage 
<pre><code>

nabular(data, only_miss = FALSE, ...)
</code></pre>
#### Arguments 

* ``data``:  a dataframe
only_miss logical - if FALSE (default) it will bind a dataframe with all of the variables
duplicated with their shadow. Setting this to TRUE will bind variables only
those variables that contain missing values. See the examples for more details.
... extra options to pass to recode_shadow() - a work in progress.

#### Value 

data with the added variable shifted and the suffix _NA

#### See Also 

bind_shadow()

#### Examples 
```{r}

aq_nab <- nabular(airquality)
aq_s <- bind_shadow(airquality)
all.equal(aq_nab, aq_s)
