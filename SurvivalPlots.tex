\subsection{Survival Plots}

\begin{itemize}
%----------------------------%
% 1. **Background and Objective:** 

\item Survival–agreement plots have been suggested as a new graphical approach to assess agreement in
quantitative variables. We propose that survival analytical techniques can complement this method, providing a new analytical insight
for agreement.

%----------------------------%
% 2. **Methods:** 

\item Two survival–agreement plots are used to detect the bias between to measurements of the same variable. The presence of
bias is tested with log-rank test, and its magnitude with Cox regression.
%----------------------------%
% 3. **Results:** 

\item An example on C-reactive protein determinations shows how survival analytical methods would be interpreted in the context
of assessing agreement.

%----------------------------%
% 4. **Conclusion:** 
\item Log-rank test, Cox regression, or other analytical methods could be used to assess agreement in quantitative variables;
correct interpretations require good clinical sense
